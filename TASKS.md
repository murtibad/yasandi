# TASKS

**Owner decision (2026-09-29): no new scenarios for now.** Improve the existing six: more absurd turns, more reply variants, better endings. Scenario ideas stay in `ideas/` for later.

Queue for AI agents. Take the first item under **Ready**. Follow `AGENTS.md` (read "Turkish voice" and "Memes and trends" twice). Never push to `main`; push a branch. One task per branch.

### 8. (Ready for next tasks if any)

## Later (owner's ideas, not for agents yet)

- Anonymous story submissions: a "Hikâyeni anlat" link already exists in the page, hidden until `STORY_FORM_URL` in `js/main.js` is set (e.g. a Google Form). Later: collect them, turn the best into scenario beats.
- Unmatched inputs: send `yasandi.unmatched` to a free database so we can see what players type.
- Endings gallery: a page listing found/missing endings per scenario (titles of missing ones hidden).

## Done

- Comedy pass on all six scenarios (`content/comedy-pass`, branch `content/comedy-pass`)
- Header controls: visible and animated (`feature/header-controls`, branch `feature/header-controls`)
